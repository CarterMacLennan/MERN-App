# Notes Application
A responsive notes application developed with the MERN software stack.

> This application was developed in tandem with
> my research on how JavaScript evolved from
> client-side to server-side. It's used to showcase
> the core technologies that allowed for full stack
> JavaScript development.

### Responsive & Get Request
By utilizing [bootstrap's grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/), notes are able to adapt to the size of the viewport.

A **get("/notes")** request is called using [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-react) as you enter the site, and after a note has been added or deleted. When its called, a stately variable called loading, is set to true while the request is being called. As a result, the landingPage component is updated to render a spinner. Using the [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) model on the server-side, it filters through the database and returns all note documents to the client. When the data is returned, the stately variable is set to true, allowing the array of note objects to be mapped onto card.js components and rendered to the display.

### Text Area Autosizing & Put Request
Using the npm package [react-text-area-autosize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-textarea-autosize) the title and body of notes automatically adjust to the size required to show all the text. 

When a card’s onblur event occurs (when you leave a text area) we perform a **put("/notes/update/:id")** request on the client-side using [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-react). Using the [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) model on the server-side, it filters through the database for a document with the id found in the parameters of the put request. After, the fields of this document are
updated with the title and body arguments found in the body of the request object. Then, the document is saved in order to apply the changes to the database.

### Delete Request
A **delete("/notes/delete/:id")** request is triggered using [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-react) when a card’s x icon is clicked.  Using the [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) model on the server-side, it filters through the database for a
document with the id found in the parameters of the put request. Once the document has been found, it is deleted from the database. We then make a **get(“/notes”)** request to our server.

### Create Request
A **post("/notes/create/")** request is called using [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-react) when the [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) button with a [font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) plus icon is clicked. The server responds by creating an instance of a note model and saves it to the database. A new document is added to the collection with initially empty title and body attributes. An id field is auto generated by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), to be used as its primary key. Once the request has been fulfilled, we make a **get(“/notes”)** request to our server.

### MERN STACK
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Used to store records as JSON-like documents in a NoSQL database 
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Used to perform a series of middleware function calls, and run the node server 
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - Used to enable next gen JavaScript, and map data to reusable UI components.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) - Used as a runtime environment for JS & install third-party packages

### TECH
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - An ODM used to provide structure to the data I wished to store in
MongoDB
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-react) - To perform XMLHttpRequests to our node.js server
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - A UI library used to create responsive UI components.
* [react-text-area-autosize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-textarea-autosize) - To allow our text areas to autosize to the amount of text entered.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used to provide a plus icon

### Todos
* Move database to mongo atlas
* To deploy to heroku, update package.json & server.js
