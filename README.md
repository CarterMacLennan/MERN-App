# Notes Application
A responsive notes application developed with the MERN software stack.

> This application was developed in tandem with
> my research on how JavaScript evolved from
> client-side to server-side. It's used to showcase
> the core technologies that allowed for full stack
> JavaScript development.

### MERN STACK
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Used to store records as JSON-like documents in a NoSQL database 
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Used to perform a series of middleware function calls, and run the node server 
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - Used to enable next gen JavaScript, and map data to reusable UI components.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) - Used as a runtime environment for JS & install third-party packages

### TECH
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - An ODM used to provide structure to the data I wished to store in
MongoDB
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - A UI library used to create responsive UI components.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used to provide a plus icon

### Todos
* Move database to mongo atlas
* To deploy to heroku, update package.json & server.js
